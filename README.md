This is our Final Project.
# P40 Underdog Project 

## Description
Our project is called “P-40 Underdogs", a dog support program intended to schedule walks and provide dog adoption. 
We are developing a user-friendly web app that allows users to schedule walks, donate, and adopt dogs. 
Our web app includes marshals, and they can also register through the platform to help manage the walks and ensure everything is running smoothly.

## Features
Scheduling Walks 
	- Option to schedule, reschedule, and cancel walks
	- Users can schedule walks through an online calendar provided in our web app.
	 
Adoption Board
	- Users can adopt any breed of dogs
	- Users can view profiles of the dogs, including the dog's name, age, and category(puppy, adult, or senior)
	
Donations & Support
	- Users can choose how much they wish to donate 
	- Users can use a credit card or Google Pay to donate

## How to install readMe
To install a readMe file, you need a plain text file like "Notepad" on your Windows computer.
If you have a MacOS instead, you can download BBEdit as a text file, and it will still function properly.
Once you have opened a text file, you can write whatever you want in the readme file.

Next, save the file as readMe.md
After saving the file, place the file into the main folder of your project
You can also use a version control platform such as GitHub, and others can view it.
